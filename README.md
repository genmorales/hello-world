# hello-world

it's Gendry here. 

i was a backend developer a long time ago, then spent a lot of time in leadership navigating the land of the humans. 
have got back on the tools again after i fell in love with ethereum & blockchain. 
now i try to bring the human world and blockchain tech world closer together.
